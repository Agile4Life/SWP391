# API contract workflow

The API team publishes an OpenAPI YAML/JSON export here when an endpoint is ready for frontend integration. Every change must specify request, successful response and common error response.

Frontend may use a local mock matching the contract, but must remove the mock before the Jira ticket is moved to Done.

`openapi-public.yaml` defines the anonymous, read-only landing catalog. It shares package, coach and session data with the authenticated portal; fixture data in browser verification scripts is never used by the application.

[`openapi-pwa-checkin.yaml`](openapi-pwa-checkin.yaml) defines signed gate QR generation and authenticated Member self check-in for the Android/iOS portal PWA (SCRUM-75/83/87 extension).
